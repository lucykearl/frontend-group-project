### Fitness Tracking App

We built a fitness tracking app for gym goers and anyone interested in fitness to note down their training sessions. We wanted to create an easy, straightforward app for someone to be able to track their progress, see how they improve over time and successfully reach their fitness goals.

### Included in the app:

- You are able to create a user account
- Log in and out with ease
- Add your fitness sessions - this will allow you to select the exercise of your choice (it also includes an autocomplete option if you start to type), note down the weight and the amount of reps you want to complete
- You are then able to continue to add your sets and finish once you are done
- 'History' in the bottom navigation bar will allow you to view your previous fitness sessions
- The homepage will show your progess via tables, giving you a visual representation of your progression

- If you want to add another set of the same exercise, just press 'ADD SET' and this will allow you to keep the same weight and rep of the previous set or edit it to increase or decrease
- If you make a mistake, there is the option to remove the set by pressing 'REMOVE' next to the set you wish to get rid of
- You can do this until you have noted down all the exercises you want to include in your session that day
