REP

Fitness Tracking App

We built a fitness tracking app for gym goers and anyone interested in fitness to note down their training sessions. We wanted to create an easy, straightforward app for someone to be able to track their progress, see how they improve over time and successfully reach their fitness goals.

Included in the app:

You are able to create a user account
Log in and out with ease
Add your fitness sessions - this will allow you to select the exercise of your choice (it also includes an autocomplete option if you start to type), note down the weight and the amount of reps you want to complete
You are then able to continue to add your sets and finish once you are done
Clicking on history in the bottom navigation bar will allow you to view your previous fitness sessions
The homepage will show your progess via tables, giving you a visual representation of your progress
